It generates a static website based on your application's source code and JSDoc comments. \nThe generated website includes details about your modules, services, routes, classes, interfaces, decorators, and more, providing a complete overview of your application's structure and functionality.\nHere's how to use Compodoc and update the documentation for your project:\n\nUnderstanding the Commands\n\nnpm run docs:gen: This command generates the documentation based on your application's source code and JSDoc comments. The generated documentation is placed in the ./documentation/generated directory.\n\nnpm run docs:serve: This command not only generates the documentation but also starts a local server and opens the generated documentation website in your default web browser.\n\n\n\nAdding Additional Markdown Documentation\nYou can add additional Markdown documentation to your project by creating new .md files in the ./documentation/includes directory. Each .md file you add corresponds to a separate page of the documentation.\nWhen adding custom .md files, they also need to be added to the summary.json inside the ./documentation/includes directory. This file is required so compodoc knows at which level to put this page, as you can also nest pages.\n More info here\n\n\nRemember to commit and push your changes to the repository, so that others can access the updated documentation.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
